title: Recipes
description: Seven jobs, start to finish. Each one is a program that compiles against the library, and the output on the page is what it printed.

The rest of these docs are organised by feature: presence, keys, rules, checks, formats.
Each page answers *what does this do*.

These answer *I am building X, which of those do I combine, and in what order*. They are
the pieces assembled, for seven jobs people actually have.

| Recipe | What it pulls together |
|---|---|
| [A JSON API endpoint](/recipes/api-endpoint/) | Content negotiation, rules, problem details, status codes |
| [An application config file](/recipes/config-file/) | TOML or YAML, defaults, unknown-key warnings, carets at boot |
| [An API that keeps changing](/recipes/moving-api/) | Aliases, fallbacks, open enums, collected extras |
| [A form with errors on the fields](/recipes/form-errors/) | Paths to field names, codes to your own wording |
| [A CSV file](/recipes/csv/) | Row decoding, text cells, row-indexed failures |
| [A SQL result set](/recipes/sql-rows/) | The driver adapter, batching, global row numbers |
| [A file you do not trust](/recipes/untrusted-input/) | Limits, the accepting list, what each budget stops |

## These are programs, not snippets

Every recipe is a target in this site's build. It compiles against the real package, it
runs, and what you see on the page is what it printed — the same rule as the rest of the
site, applied to whole programs rather than to single examples.

That constraint does the editorial work. A recipe that cannot be written as a working
program is not a recipe; it is a guide page that already exists. It also means these
cannot rot quietly: if an API changes under them, the site stops building.

It has already earned its keep. Writing the first one turned up an HTTP handler that
answered 415 while the body it served said 422, and writing the CSV one turned up a
documented capability that did not work at all. Both are fixed; the pages show the fixed
behaviour, because they show whatever the library actually does.

## What they are not

Not a cheatsheet. [That exists](/start/cheatsheet/) and answers "remind me of the
spelling". If a recipe here is only a list of syntax, it should be deleted.

Not a tour of the API either. Each one solves one job and stops, and links to the guide
when you want the full surface.
